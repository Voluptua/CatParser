# What's CatParser?

CatParser is a C/C++ code parser which allows the user to edit the code more easily and flexible. It's written in Rust, but why would you use it? Well, this project was created for other people to create their own Pok√©mon decompilation ROM-hacking tools that allows the user to EASILY read and write to C code, but of course, can be used for other projects as well.

# State of development

This repository was just recently created. However, since I am working on my ROM-hacking tool `Porydelete` and I need to edit C code as well, I will be working on this once I get more time to work on it and have enough knowledge about regular expressions in the Rust programming language.

# How you will be able to use it, once its done 

Here's some example code: 

```rust
use catparser::catparser;
use std::collections::HashMap;

fn main() {
    let contents = catparser::parse("./example.c")?; // Reads the C code from ./example.c
    let map = catparser::deserialize(&contents); // Deserializes the contents

    let _ = map.remove("SampleFunction()"); // Removes the sample function from the code

    // --snip--
}
```
